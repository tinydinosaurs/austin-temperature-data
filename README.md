# Austin Weather Data
There are a lot of cool data visualization projects related to global warming üî•.

Me, I'm interested in looking at its effects locally. For me, local is Austin, Texas. And in Austin over the last several years we've seen highs and lows that are consistently higher than normal. My goal is to create a visualization of the departure from normal for daily high and low temps.

Anyone who has tried to find a good, free weather API knows the difficulty I'm going to have here. If you know of a good one, let me know. Otherwise, I'll include what I use in this README.

This projects is made ‚ù§Ô∏è lovingly ‚ù§Ô∏è with create-react-app.
